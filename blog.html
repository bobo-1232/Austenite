                            Cats of West Campus have cared for 5-10 abandoned and feral cats on West Campus 
                            since 2014, and they frequently updated the health issues of many cats.
                            For example, Domino is an elderly cat that guarded west campus for at least nine years,
                            and yet he's recently diagnosed with serious breathing issues that may endanger his life.
                            Please pray for this fur baby.

                                One of my goals this year is to read all the books that I'd read when I was 15. 
                                I remember reading Catcher in the Rye three times, and my perception of the main character Holden
                                Caulfield changed each time I reread the book. 
                                When I was 15, I thought Holden was mature, brave, and humorous, ignoring 
                                Holden was a lost, depressed teenager who couldn't understand his feelings. 
                                When I was 17, I realized that Holden didn't find the right way to cope with his depression, 
                                and he tried every way to escape from his problems. 
                                He was naive and anxious and needed help from adults.
                                I became empathetic toward him when I reread the book. 
                                The book always reminded me of a piece of my adolescence.
